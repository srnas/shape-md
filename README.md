# coordinates from SRP-RNA simulations with SHAPE reagent

These are additional supporting files for the paper entitled "MD Simulations Reveal an Interplay between Reagent Binding and RNA Dynamics behind SHAPE Chemistry" by Mlynsky and Bussi.
Folder "pdb-s_all-clusters" contains coordinates (in PDB format) of SRP-RNA structure with BzCN reagent, where each PDB file contains various clusters of BzCN binding towards 2'-OH group of particular nucleotide. 
Example of PLUMED input file (plumed_g3.dat) is also attached. More information upon request at vmlynsky@sissa.it or at vojtech dot mlynsky (snail) gmail dot com.
